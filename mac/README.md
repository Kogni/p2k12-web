get_macaddr.php

The get_macaddr returns a list with previously connected devices.

index.php and wlan_mac.php

These scripts are unrelated to get_macaddr.php. index.php is used for registering devices to p2k12. wlan_mac.php is used for our IRC bot to get the currently registered and connected devices.
